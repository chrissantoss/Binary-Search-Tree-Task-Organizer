# Binary-Search-Tree-Task-Organizer
Uses the Binary Search Tree ADT to model and implement this prototype.

Each task item will be recorded as an instance of BinarySearchTree::TaskItemclass. Each record will include item priority (not unique) stored as an integer and item description stored as a string along with corresponding left and right pointers. BinarySearchTree class will be used as a container to handle TaskItem objects. BinarySearchTree will also include relevant member attributes and methods.
